# Contributing

## Getting Started

These contributing guidelines should be read by software developers wishing to contribute code or
documentation changes into OpenOA, or to push changes upstream to the main NREL/OpenOA repository.

1. Create a fork of OpenOA on GitHub
2. Clone your fork of the repository

    ```bash
    git clone -b develop https://github.com/<your-GitHub-username>/OpenOA.git
    ```

3. Move into the OpenOA source code directory

    ```bash
    cd OpenOA/
    ```

4. Install OpenOA in editable mode with the appropriate developer tools

   - ``".[develop]"`` is for the linting, autoformatting, and code checking tools
   - ``".[docs]"`` is for the documentation building tools. Ideally, developers should also be
     contributing to the documentation, and therefore checking that the documentation builds locally.

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[develop,docs]"
    ```

5. Turn on the automated linting and code checking tools. Pre-commit runs at the commit level, and
   will only check files that have been modified and staged (`git add <your-changed-file>`).

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Keeping your fork in sync with NREL/OpenOA

The "main" OpenOA repository is regularly updated with ongoing research at NREL and beyond. After
creating and cloning your fork from the previous section, you might be wondering how to keep it
up to date with the latest improvements.

Please note that the below process may introduce merge conflicts with your work, and this does not
provide guidance about how to deal those conflicts. Here is a good resource for working on
[merge conflicts](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts) that will
inevitably arise in development work.

1. Ensure you're in the OpenOA folder. This may look different depending on your operating system.

   ```bash
   cd /your/path/to/OpenOA/
   ```

2. If you haven't already, add NREL/OpenOA as the "upstream" location (or whichever naming
   convention you prefer).

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/NREL/OpenOA.git
   ```

   To find the name you've given NREL/Openoa again, you can simply run the following to display
   all of the remote sources you're tracking.

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. Fetch all of the remote changes

   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   ```

4. Sync the upstream (NREL) changes

   ```bash
   # If there was a new release this will need to be updated
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main

   # Most common branch to bring up to speed
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   ```

5. Bring your feature branch up to date with the latest changes, assuming you started from the
   develop branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your_contribution
   git merge develop
   ```

## Issue Tracking

New feature requests, changes, enhancements, non-methodology features, and bug reports can be filed
as new issues in the [Github.com issue tracker](https://github.com/NREL/OpenOA/issues) at any time.
Please be sure to fully describe the issue.

For other issues, please email the OpenOA distribution list at `openoa@nrel.gov`.

### Issue Submission Checklist

1. Does the issue already exist?
   Yes: If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your
   [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).
   Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

   - üëç - upvote
   - üëé - downvote

2. Is this an individual bug report or feature request?
3. Can the bug or new feature be easily reproduced?
   1. Be sure to include enough details about your setup and the issue you've encountered
   2. Simplify as much of the code as possible to better isolate the problem

## Repository

The OpenOA repository is hosted on Github, and located here: http://github.com/NREL/OpenOA

This repository is organized using a modified git-flow system. Branches are organized as follows:

- main: Stable release version. Must have good test coverage and may not have all the newest features.
- develop: Development branch which contains the newest features. Tests must pass, but code may be
  unstable.
- feature/xxx: Feature ranch from develop, should reference a github issue number.
- fix/xxx: Bug fix branch from develop, should reference a github issue number. Can be based off
  main if this is a necessary patch.

To work on a feature, please fork OpenOA first and then create a feature branch in your own fork.
Work out of this feature branch before submitting a pull request.
Be sure to periodically synchronize the upstream develop branch into your feature branch to avoid conflicts in the pull request.

When your branch is ready, make a pull request to NREL/OpenOA through the
[GitHub web interface](https://github.com/NREL/OpenOA/pulls). When submitting a pull request, you
will need to accept the Contributor License Agreement(CLA).

## Coding Style

This code uses a ``pre-commit`` workflow where code styling and linting is taken care of when a user
commits their code. Specifically, this code utilizes ``black`` for automatic formatting (line length, quotation usage, hanging
lines, etc.), ``isort`` for automatic import sorting, and ``flake8`` for linting.

To activate the ``pre-commit`` workflow, the user must install the develop version as outlined in the
[Readme](https://github.com/NREL/OpenOA/tree/develop#Development), and run the following line:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Documentation

Documentation is written primarily using ReStructured Text, with some components written in
Markdown, and is located in the `OpenOA/sphinx/` directory. Additionally, all method and class documentation
is written as Google-style docstrings in the code itself, with some aspects documented inline as
needed.

If the `docs` extras haven't already been installed, be sure to do so before you attempt to build
the documentation site.

```bash
# Navigate to the top level directory of the repository
cd OpenOA/

# Install the additional dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

To build the documentation locally, first ensure that
[Pandoc is installed](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) on your computer. Once confirmed, you
need to navigate to the `sphinx/` folder, and then run the build command as follows.

```bash
# Assuming you're already in OpenOA/
cd sphinx/

# Copy any updated examples to the sphinx examples directory
cp ../examples/<new-or-updated-example>.ipynb examples/

# Build the docs
make html
```

## Testing

All code should be paired with a corresponding unit or integration test. OpenOA uses both pytest and
the built in unittest framework.

To run the tests you can use any of the following commands, depending on your needs.

1. All the tests and check for test coverage:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=openoa
   ```

2. All the tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. Only the unit tests:

   ```bash
   pytest --unit
   ```

4. Only the regression (integration) tests:

   ```bash
   pytest --regression
   ```

## Pull Request

Pull requests must be made for all changes. Most pull requests should be made against the develop
branch unless patching a bug that needs to be addressed immediately, and only core developers should
make pull requests to the main branch.

All pull requests, regardless of the base branch, must include updated documentation and pass all
unit tests and integration tests. In addition, code coverage should not be negatively affected.

### Scope

Encapsulate the changes of one issue, or multiple if they are highly related. Three small pull
requests is greatly preferred over one large pull request. Not only will the review process be
shorter, but the review will be more focused and of higher quality, benefitting the author and code
base. Be sure to write a complete description of these changes in the pull request body.

### Tests

All tests must pass. Pull requests will be rejected or have changes requested if tests do not pass,
or cannot pass with changes. Tests are automatically run through Github Actions for any pull request
or push to the main or develop branches, but should also be run locally before submission.

#### Test Coverage

The testing framework described below will generate a coverage report from the tests run through
GitHub Actions. Please ensure that your work is fully covered by running them locally with the
coverage report enabled.

### Documentation

Include any relevant changes to inline documentation, docstrings, and any of the RST files located
in `OpenOA/sphinx/`. Pull requests will not be accepted until these changes are complete.

### Changelog

All changes must be documented appropriately in CHANGELOG.md in the [Unreleased] section.

## Release Process

This section is a reference for OpenOA's maintainers to keep processes largely consistent
over time, regardless of who the core developers are.

1. Bump version number and metadata in `openoa/__init__.py`
2. Bump version numbers of any dependencies in `setup.py`. Be sure to separate to keep dependencies
   separated by what they are required for, i.e., documentation dependencies in `DOCS` or core
   dependencies in `REQUIRED`.
3. Update the changelog at `OpenOA/CHANGELOG.md`, changing the "UNRELEASED" section to the new
   version and the release date (e.g. "[2.3 - 2022-01-18]").
4. Make a pull request into develop with these updates, and be sure to follow the guide in
   [Pull Requests](#pull-request).

5. Merge develop into main through the git command line

  ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge develop
   git push
   ```

- Tag the new release version:

  ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Tag message for v1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

- Deploying a Package to PyPi
  - The repository is equipped with a github action to build and publish new versions to PyPI. A maintainer can invoke this workflow by pushing a tag to the NREL/OpenOA repository with prefix "v", such as "v1.2.3".
  - The action is defined in `.github/workflows/tags-to-pypi.yml`.
