Overview
********

This library provides a framework for working with timeseries data from wind plants. Its development
has been motivated by the Wind Plant Performance Prediction (WP3) Benchmarking (PRUF) project, which
aims to provide a reference implementaiton for plant-level performance assessment.

Data processing and ETL is handled by the PlantData class, which in turn relies on Pandas data frames.
PlantData can be used to import, inspect, pre-process, and save the raw data from wind turbines, revenue meters,
meteorological (met) towers, and reanalysis products such as MERRA-2.

Analysis routines are provided in analysis classes, which each use the PlantData objects to ingest data. OpenOA includes the following analysis classes:

* MonteCarloAEP: This routine estimates the long-term annual energy production (AEP) of a wind plant (typically over
  10-20 years) based on operational data from a shorter period of record (e.g., 1-3 years), along with the uncertainty.
* TurbineLongTermGrossEnergy: This routine estimates the long-term turbine ideal energy (TIE) of a wind plant, defined
  as the long-term AEP that would be generated by the wind plant if all turbines operated normally (i.e., no downtime,
  derating, or severe underperformance, but still subject to wake losses and moderate performance losses), along with
  the uncertainty.
* ElectricalLosses: The ElectricalLosses routine estimates the average electrical losses at a wind plant, along with the
  uncertainty, by comparing the energy produced at the wind turbines to the energy delivered to the grid.
* EYAGapAnalysis: This class is used to perform a gap analysis between the estimated AEP from a pre-construction energy
  yield estimate (EYA) and the actual AEP. The gap analysis compares different wind plant performance categories to
  help understand the sources of differences between EYA AEP estimates and actual AEP, specifically 1) availability
  losses, 2) electrical losses, and 3) TIE.
* WakeLosses: This routine estimates long-term internal wake losses experienced by a wind plant and for each individual
  turbine, along with the uncertainty.

Lower-level "toolkit" modules are provided in the utils subpackage. These methods are used throughout the analysis classes. They can also be used individually to support general wind plant data analysis activities. Some examples of utils modules include:

* Quality Assurance: This module provides quality assurance methods for identifying potential quality issues with SCADA
  data.
* Filters: This module provides functions for flagging operational data based on a range of criteria (e.g., outlier
  detection).
* Power Curve: The power curve module contains methods for fitting power curve models to SCADA data.
* Imputing: This module provides methods for filling in missing data with imputed values.
* Met Data Processing: This module contains methods for processing meteorological data, such as computing air
  density and wind shear coefficients.
* Plotting: This module contains convenient functions for creating plots, such as power curve plots and maps showing
  the wind plant layout.

More information about the analysis methods in OpenOA and their use in the WP3 Benchmarking project can be found in the
following publications. A summary of the OpenOA software is published in :cite:`ind-PerrSauer_JOSS_2021`. An overview
of the WP3 Benchmarking project showing a comparison between pre-construction AEP estimates and operational AEP for 10
commercial wind plants, estimated using the MonteCarloAEP method in OpenOA, is provided in
:cite:`ind-Fields_NREL_2021`. Benefits of the augmented AEP assessment features in the MonteCarloAEP method (e.g.,
machine learning, multivariate regression) are discussed in :cite:`ind-Bodini_WE_2021`. A partial gap analysis between
pre-construction AEP estimates and operational AEP, using the MonteCarloAEP, TurbineLongTermGrossEnergy, and
ElectricalLosses methods in OpenOA, is presented in :cite:`ind-Todd_WE_2022`.
