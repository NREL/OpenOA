Project Data
==================

New data imported into the operational_analysis toolkit can take advantage of the data structures in the `types` module.
The base class is operational_analysis.types.PlantData, which represents all known pieces of data about a given wind plant.

Reanalysis Products
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reanalysis products are included as Plant Data objects and, regardless
of data source, have a standardized set of field names and types (see below).
That said, the data sources are obviously different, as are the methods use to
calculate these standard fields from the raw datasets. These methods are described here.

PlantData.reanalysis.product["merra2"]

MERRA-2 data are based on the single-level diagnostic data available here:

https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/M2T1NXSLV_V5.12.4/summary?keywords=%22MERRA-2%22

Wind speed and direction are taken directly from the diagnostic 50-m u- and v-wind
fields provided in this dataset. Air density at 50m is calculated using temperature
and pressure estimations at 50m and the ideal gas law. Temperature at 50m is estimated by taking the 10-m
temperature data provided by this dataset and assuming a constant lapse rate of -9.8
degrees Celsius per vertical kilometer. Pressure at 50m is extrapolated from surface pressure
data provided in this dataset using the hypsometric equation.

 windspeed_ms         float64
 winddirection_deg    float64
 rho_kgm-3            float64
==================== ====================

PlantData.reanalysis.product["ncep2"]

NCEP-2 data are based on the single-level diagnostic data available here:

https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds091.0/

Wind speed and direction are taken directly from the diagnostic 10-m u- and v-wind
fields provided in this dataset. Air density at 10m is calculated using temperature
and pressure estimations at 10m and the ideal gas law. Temperature at 10m is estimated by taking the 2-m
temperature data provided by this dataset and assuming a constant lapse rate of -9.8
degrees Celsius per vertical kilometer. Pressure at 10m is extrapolated from surface pressure
data provided in this dataset using the hypsometric equation.

==================== ====================

 winddirection_deg    float64
 rho_kgm-3            float64
==================== ====================


PlantData.reanalysis.product["erai"]

ERA-interim data are based on the model-level data available here:

https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds627.0/

Model levels are based on sigma coordinates (i.e. fractions of surface pressure). From this dataset, we
extract temperature, u-wind, and v-wind at the 58th model level, which is on average about 72m above ground level
(https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/60-model-levels). We also extract surface pressure
data. Air density at the 58th model level is calculated using temperature data extracted at that level and an estimation
of pressure at that level using the ideal gas law. Pressure at the 58th model level is extrapolated from surface pressure
data provided in this dataset using the hypsometric equation.
