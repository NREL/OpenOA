    "# Intro to the OpenOA `PlantData` and QA Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be using the ENGIE open data set for the La Haute Borne wind power plant, and demonstrating how to use the quality assurance (QA) methods in OpenOA to help get this data ready for use with the `PlantData` class. This notebook will walk through the creation of the `project_Engie` module, especially the `prepare()` method that returns either the cleaned data or a `PlantData` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we work with `project_ENGIE.py` to standardize the QCing of the La Haute Borne data, it should be noted that the use of an external script to load in data is entirely optional. For instance, a user could do all their work in a single script, set up a template Jupyter Notebook for working with data, or any other means that produces the data that can be read into `PlantData` and the associated metadata (`PlantMetaData`), as determined by the user input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `PlantData` object\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PlantData` object is the core data structure for OpenOA, which is used for importing and validating wind power plant operational data for analysis in OpenOA. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What's changed in v3?\n",
    "\n",
    "For users that are well acquainted with OpenOA and its data structures, there are a few changes to the ways the code now operates:\n",
    "- All data objects such as `PlantData.scada` are pandas `DataFrame`s now, so there is no longer the need to access the data via `PlantData.scada._df`\n",
    "- Because all data objects are pandas `DataFrame`s, `AssetData` and `ReanalysisData` have been dropped in favor of: `PlantData.asset` and `PlantData.reanalysis`, respectively.\n",
    "- Reanalysis data is the only data object that diverges, and is now a dictionary of `DataFrame`s, which enables the use of an arbitrary number of reanalysis products to be imported and used\n",
    "- There are now a number of convenience methods, such as `PlantData.turbine_ids`, `PlantData.tower_ids`, `PlantData.turbine_df()`, and `PlantData.tower_df()` for commonly used data access routines.\n",
    "- `PlantData` is now accompanied by a `PlantMetaData` object that is powered by dictionaries to help routinely set up mappings between user data formats and OpenOA internal formats that use an IEC-25 schematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `PlantData` and `PlantMetaData` 101\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PlantData` object, as previously stated, is the central data repository and object for working with operational data in OpenOA. All of the analysis methods are built around this object for both API consistency and to make OpenOA easily extensible to new/more analysis methods. For the OpenOA examples, the metadatafile: `data/plant_meta.yml` will be used (and a JSON reference for those that prefer JSON: `data/plant_meta.json`) to map the La Haute Borne fields to the OpenOA fields. This v3 update allows a user to bring their data directly into a `PlantData` object with a means for the OpenOA to know which data fields are being used \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a demonstration of loading a `PlantMetaData`object directly to show what data are\n",
    "expected, though there is a `PlantMetaData.load()` that can accept a dictionary or file path input for routinized workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "metadata = PlantMetaData(\n",
    "    latitude,  # float\n",
    "    longitude,  # float\n",
    "    scada,  # dictionary of column mappings and data frequency\n",
    "    meter,  # dictionary of column mappings and data frequency\n",
    "    tower,  # dictionary of column mappings and data frequency\n",
    "    status,  # dictionary of column mappings and data frequency\n",
    "    curtail,  # dictionary of column mappings and data frequency\n",
    "    asset,  # dictionary of column mappings\n",
    "    reanalysis,  # dictionary of each product's dictionary of column mappings and data frequency\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "For each of the data objects above, there is a corresponding meta data class to help guide users. For instance, the `SCADAMetaData` (below) has pre-set attributes to help guide users outside of the docstrings and standard documentation. The other meta data objects are: `MeterMetaData`, `TowerMetaData`, `StatusMetaData`, `CurtailMetaData`, `AssetMetaData`, and `ReanalysisMetaData` (one is created for each producted provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, each of the metadata classes allows inputs for the column mappings and timestamp frequency to enable the data validation steps outlined in [Step 5](#Step-5:-Translating-this-work-into-a-data-loading-script-for-PlantData). However to clarify the units and data types exected, each of the metadata classes contains the immutable attributes: `units` and `dtypes`, as shown below for the `SCADAMetaData` class, to signal to users what units each data input should be in, when passed, and what type the data should be able to be converted to, if it's not already in that format. Some examples of acceptable formats would be string-encode floats, or string-encoded timestamps, both of which can be automatically converted in the initialization steps."

    "### Step 2: Convert the timestamps to proper timestamp data objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `qa.convert_datetime_column()` method, we can convert the timestamp data accordingly and insert the UTC-encoded data as an index for both the timezone aware, and timezone unaware data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood this method does a few helpful items to create the resulting data set:\n",
    "1) Converts the column \"Date_time\" to a datetime object\n",
    "2) Creates the new datetime columns: \"Date_time_localized\" and \"Date_time_utc\" for the localized and UTC-encoded datetime objects\n",
    "3) Sets the UTC timestamp as the index\n",
    "4) Creates the column \"utc_offset\" containing the difference between the UTC timestamp and the localized timestamp that will be used to determine if the timestamp is in DST or not.\n",
    "5) Creates the column \"is_dst\" indicating if the timestamps are in DST (`True`), or not (`False`) that will be used later when trying to assess time gaps and duplications in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the resulting data that the data type of the column \"Date_time\" is successfully made into a localized timestamp in the timezone aware example, but is kept as a non-localized timestamp in the unaware example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below, the \"Date_time_utc\" column should always remain in UTC time and the \"Date_time_localized\" column should always remain in the localized time. Conveniently, Pandas provides two methods `tz_convert()` and `tz_localize()` to toggle back and forth between timezones, which will operate on the index of the DataFrame. It is worth noting that the local time could also be UTC, in which case the two columns would be redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The localized time, even when the passed data is unaware, is adjusted using the `local_tz` keyword argument to help normalize the time strings, from which a UTC-based timestamp is created (even when local is also UTC). By calculating the UTC time from the local time, we are able to ascertain DST shifts in the data, and better assess any anomalies that may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there may be cases where the timezone is neither encoded (the unaware example), nor known. In the former, we can use the `local_tz` keyword argument that is seen in the code above, but for the latter, this is much more difficult, and the default value of UTC may not be accurate. In this latter case it is useful to try multiple timezones, such as an operating/owner company's headquarters or often the windfarm's location to find a best fit. \n",

Aligning with the table version below, we can see that some distrbiutions, such as \"Ws_avg\" don't have any outliers, whereas others such as \"Ot_avg\" do and have very narrow histograms to accommadate this behavior."

    "In the below, timezone unaware data, we can see that there is a significant deviation between the local timestamps and the UTC timestamps, especialy around the end of March in both 2018 and 2019, suggesting that there is something missing with the DST data. \n",

Notice that the UTC converted data are showing duplications at roughly the same time each year when the spring-time European DST shift occurs, and is likely indicating that the original datetime stamps are missing the data to properly shift the duplicates."

    "Below, we can observe the effects of not having timezones encoded, and what that might mean for potential analyses. In the unaware data, it appears that the original data (blue, solid line, labeled \"Original Timestamp\") has a time gap in the spring; however, when we compare it to the UTC timestamp (orange, dashed line), it is clear that there is not in fact any gap in the data, and the DST transition has been encoded properly in the data. On the otherhand, it at first appears that there are no gaps in the fall when we make the same comparison, but when looking at the UTC timestamps, we can see that there is a 1 hour gap in the data for both 2014 and 2015. This is in line with our comparison of the original and UTC time gaps above, and further confirms our findings that there are duplicates in the spring and gaps in the fall.\n",

    "By having the original data and a UTC-converted timestamp it enables us to see any gaps that may appear when there is no timezone data encoded. On the other hand, using the UTC-converted timestamp does not reduce the number of duplications in this dataset that are present in the spring, but helps adjust for seemingly missing or available data. In tandem we can see in the scatter points that there are still duplicates in the spring data just before the DST switch."
