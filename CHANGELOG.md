The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.0.1 - 2020-10-13]
- Replaced `GeoPandas` functionality with `pyproj` and `Shapely` for coordinate
reference system conversion and distance measurements.
- Moved and renamed tests and updated the documentation accordingly.

## [2.0.0 - 2020-08-11]
- Switch to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) from this release forward.
- Efficiency improvements in AEP calculation
- Energy Yield Analysis (EYA) added to Operational Assessment (OA) Gap Analysis method
- Uncertainty quantification for electrical losses and longterm turbine gross energy
- Implemented open source Engie example data
- Complete update of example notebooks
- Switch to standard BSD-3 Clause license
- Automated quality control method to assist with data ingestion. Tools in this method include daylight savings time change detection and identification of the diurnal cycle.
- Add electrical losses method
- Method for estimating long-term turbine gross energy (excluding downtime and underperformance losses)
- CI pipeline using Github Actions includes regression testing with Pytest, code coverage reporting via CodeCov, packaging and distribution via Pypi, and automatic documentation using ReadTheDocs.

## [1.1] - 2019-01-29
- Python3 Support
- Addition of reanalysis schemas to the Sphinx documentation
- Easy import of EIA data using new module: Metadata_Fetch
- Updated contributing.md document
- Quality checks for reanalysis data
- Improved installation instructions
- Integration tests are now performed in CI
- Performed PEP8 linting

## [1.0] - 2018-12-06
- Refactor many analysis and toolkit modules to make them conform to a standard API (init, prepare, and run method).
- Timeseries Table is now an integrated component, no sparkplug-datastructures dependency
- Plant Level AEP method w/ Monte Carlo
- Turbine / Scada level toolkits: Filtering, Imputing, Met, Pandas Plotting, Timeseries, Unit Conversion
- Most toolkits and all methods are fully documented in Sphinx.
- Two example notebooks: Operational AEP Analysis and Turbine Analysis
- All toolkits except for Pandas Plotting have > 80% test coverage.
