# Schema Reference

This is a quick reference guide to navigate the JSON and YAML data specifications for
what types of data, and their units, are expected to be used for various analysis types.

## Full Schema

[JSON](full_schema.json) [YAML](full_schema.yml)

The complete data specification of any data that might be expected to be accessed
throughout the OpenOA codebase.

## Base Electrical Losses

[JSON](base_electrical_losses_schema.json) [YAML](base_electrical_losses_schema.yml)

The minimum data specification to be able to run an electrical losses analysis.

## Base Monte Carlo AEP

[JSON](base_monte_carlo_aep_schema.json) [YAML](base_monte_carlo_aep_schema.yml)

The minimum data specification for the base Monte Carlo AEP analysis. More robust
schema is on the way for the variations on the base analysis.

## Base Turbine Ideal Energy

[JSON](base_tie_schema.json) [YAML](base_tie_schema.yml)

The minimum data specification for the base turbine ideal energy analysis. More robust
schema is on the way for the variations on the base analysis.

## Base Wake Losses

[JSON](base_wake_losses_schema.json) [YAML](base_wake_losses_schema.yml)

The minimum data specification for the base wake losses analysis. More robust
schema is on the way for the variations on the base analysis.
