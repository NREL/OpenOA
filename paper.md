# Summary

Operational analyses use collected data from wind power plants to perform assessments ranging from the diagnosis of faults and underperformance, benchmarking of performance improvements (e.g., wind sector management, vortex generators), long-term estimates of annual energy production (AEP), and building/tuning statistical or physics-based models for various applications (e.g.,, wake model validation, wind power forecasting).

The development of OpenOA started internally at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and was initiated to support the lab's efforts in the Wind Plant Performance and Prediction (WP3) Benchmark, which is a key risk reduction activity of the Performance, Risk, Uncertainty, and Finance project under the Atmosphere to Electrons initiative\footnote{https://a2e.energy.gov}). Further funding was provided through the NREL Research Data Initiative. The goal of WP3 is to provide an independent benchmark of preconstruction EYA bias (discussed in the preceding section) and to understand the sources of bias and uncertainty. OpenOA was originally scoped to calculate the operational AEP of case study wind power plants, to which EYA estimates of those plants provided by consultants could be compared. OpenOA is now expected to rapidly expand its scope to support additional types of analyses including turbine performance and reliability.

Released publicly in September 2018, OpenOA provides an open-source framework for the operational analysis of wind power plant data. The intent of this effort is to begin fostering collaboration and methods sharing in a wind industry that has historically been very protective of methods and data. Much of an OA analysis could be standard and uncontroversial, and by creating a public repository for the collection and dissemination of OA methods and best practices, significant efficiency gains can be achieved. Furthermore, over time, we hope that OpenOA will become a reference implementation for OA methods from which a published standard (IEC or otherwise) may quickly follow. To our knowledge, this approach of first fostering a collaborative repository of methods that are tested and used prior to developing a published standard is new to the wind industry, and may indeed prove more efficient than the multiyear approach of beginning immediately with a standard.
