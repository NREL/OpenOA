This library provides a framework to study operational assessment (OA) methodologies that consume
timeseries data from wind plants. Its development has been motivated by the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL) Wind Plant Performance Prediction (WP3) Benchmarking (PRUF) project [^1], which
developed an open source, baseline implementation of the 20-year annualized energy production (AEP)
for plant-level performance assessment. It has grown to incororporate several more analyses, and a
schema for time-series data from wind power plants.

### Included Analysis Methods

| Name | Description | Citations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``MonteCarloAEP`` | This routine estimates the long-term annual energy production (AEP) of a wind power plant (typically over 10-20 years) based on operational data from a shorter period of record (e.g., 1-3 years), along with the uncertainty. | [^2], [^3] |
| ``TurbineLongTermGrossEnergy``| This routine estimates the long-term turbine ideal energy (TIE) of a wind plant, defined as the long-term AEP that would be generated by the wind plant if all turbines operated normally (i.e., no downtime, derating, or severe underperformance, but still subject to wake losses and moderate performance losses), along with the uncertainty. | [^4] |
| ``ElectricalLosses``| The ElectricalLosses routine estimates the average electrical losses at a wind plant, along with the uncertainty, by comparing the energy produced at the wind turbines to the energy delivered to the grid. | [^4] |
| ``EYAGapAnalysis``| This class is used to perform a gap analysis between the estimated AEP from a pre-construction energy yield estimate (EYA) and the actual AEP. The gap analysis compares different wind plant performance categories to help understand the sources of differences between EYA AEP estimates and actual AEP, specifically availability losses, electrical losses, and TIE. | [^4] |
| ``WakeLosses``| This routine estimates long-term internal wake losses experienced by a wind plant and for each individual turbine, along with the uncertainty. | [^5] |
| ``StaticYawMisalignment``| The StaticYawMisalignment routine estimates the static yaw misalignment for individual wind turbines as a function of wind speed by comparing the estimated wind vane angle at which power is maximized to the mean wind vane angle at which the turbines operate. The routine includes uncertainty quantification. | citation |

### PlantData Schema

OpenOA contains a  `PlantData` class, which is based on Pandas data frames and provides a standardized base schema to combine raw data from wind turbines, meteorological (met) towers, revenue meters, and reanalysis products, such as MERRA-2 or ERA5. Additionally, the `PlantData` class can perform some basic validation for the data required to perform the operational analyses.

### Utility Functions

Lower-level utility modules are provided in the utils subpackage.
They can also be used individually to support general wind plant data analysis activities.
Some examples of utils modules include:

- **Quality Assurance**: This module provides quality assurance methods for identifying potential
  quality issues with SCADA data prior to importing it into a `PlantData` object.
- **Filters**: This module provides functions for flagging operational data based on a range of
  criteria (e.g., outlier detection).
- **Power Curve**: The power curve module contains methods for fitting power curve models to SCADA data.
- **Imputing**: This module provides methods for filling in missing data with imputed values.
- **Met Data Processing**: This module contains methods for processing meteorological data, such as
  computing air density and wind shear coefficients.
- **Plotting**: This module contains convenient functions for creating plots, such as power curve
  plots and maps showing the wind plant layout.

For further infromation about the features and citations, please see the [OpenOA documentation website](https://openoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## How to cite OpenOA

# Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 with pip.

We strongly recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution and creating a new conda environment for OpenOA. You can download Anaconda through [their website.](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

After installing Anaconda, create and activate a new conda environment with the name "openoa-env":

```bash
conda create --name openoa-env python=3.10
conda activate openoa-env
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the library and its dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NREL/OpenOA.git
cd OpenOA
pip install .
```

You should now be able to import openoa from the Python interpreter:

```bash
python
>>> import openoa
>>> openoa.__version__
```

#### Common Installation Issues

- In Windows you may get an error regarding geos_c.dll. To fix this install Shapely using:

```bash
conda install Shapely
```

- In Windows, an ImportError regarding win32api can also occur. This can be resolved by fixing the version of pywin32 as follows:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pywin32==255
```

#### Example Notebooks and Data

The example data will be automaticaly extracted as needed by the tests. To manually extract the example data for use with the example notebooks, use the following command:

```bash
unzip examples/data/la_haute_borne.zip -d examples/data/la_haute_borne/
```

The example notebooks are located in the `examples` directory. We suggest installing the Jupyter notebook server to run the notebooks interactively. The notebooks can also be viewed statically on [Read The Docs](http://openoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples).

```bash
jupyter lab  # "jupyter notebook" is also ok if that's your preference
```

### Development

Please see the developer section of the contributing guide [here](contributing.md), or on the [documentation site](https://openoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/contributing.html) for complete details.

Development dependencies are provided through the develop extra flag in setup.py. Here, we install
OpenOA, with development dependencies, in editable mode, and activate the pre-commit workflow (note:
this second step must be done before committing any changes):

```bash
cd OpenOA
pip install -e ".[develop, docs]"
pre-commit install
```

Occasionally, you will need to update the dependencies in the pre-commit workflow, which will provide an error when this needs to happen. When it does, this can normally be resolved with the below code, after which you can continue with your normal git workflow:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

#### Testing
Tests are written in the Python unittest or pytest framework and are runnable using pytest. There
are two types of tests, unit tests (located in `test/unit`) run quickly and are automatically for
every pull request to the OpenOA repository. Regression tests (located at `test/regression`) provide
a comprehensive suite of scientific tests that may take a long time to run (up to 20 minutes on our
machines). These tests should be run locally before submitting a pull request, and are run weekly on
the develop and main branches.

To run all unit and regresison tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run unit tests only:

```bash
pytest test/unit
```

To run all tests and generate a code coverage report

```bash
pytest --cov=openoa
```

#### Documentation

Documentation is automatically built by, and visible through
[Read The Docs](http://openoa.readthedocs.io/).

You can build the documentation with [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/), but will need
to ensure [Pandoc is installed](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) on your computer first.

```bash
cd OpenOA
pip install -e ".[docs]"
cd sphinx
make html
```
